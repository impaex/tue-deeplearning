    "Word embeddings are dense vectors of real numbers, one per word in your\n",
    "vocabulary. In NLP, it is almost always the case that your features are\n",
    "words! But how should you represent a word in a computer? You could\n",
    "store its ascii character representation, but that only tells you what\n",
    "the word *is*, it doesn't say much about what it *means* (you might be\n",
    "able to derive its part of speech from its affixes, or properties from\n",
    "its capitalization, but not much). Even more, in what sense could you\n",
    "combine these representations? We often want dense outputs from our\n",
    "neural networks, where the inputs are $|V|$ dimensional, where\n",
    "$V$ is our vocabulary, but often the outputs are only a few\n",
    "dimensional (if we are only predicting a handful of labels, for\n",
    "instance). How do we get from a massive dimensional space to a smaller\n",
    "dimensional space?\n",
    "\n",
    "How about instead of ascii representations, we use a one-hot encoding?\n",
